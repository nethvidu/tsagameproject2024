To access this project, use GitHub Desktop, and make sure to install Unity Hub(Unity 2022.3.49f1). I would advise against using your school GitHub account for this. On the webpage, click on <> Code, and copy the web URL. Then, using GitHub Desktop, go to file >> Clone Repository >> URL >> paste in the URL from before. Make sure to specify where the local files end up.
